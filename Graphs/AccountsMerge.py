from typing import List

# Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of 
# strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name,
#  and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

# Now, we would like to merge these accounts.
#  Two accounts definitely belong to the same person
#  if there is some common email to both accounts.
#  Note that even if two accounts have the same name,
#  they may belong to different people as people could have the same name.
#  A person can have any number of accounts initially,
#  but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

# After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format:
#  the first element of each account is the name, and
#  the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order.
#  The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: accounts = [
#     ["neet","neet@gmail.com","neet_dsa@gmail.com"],
#     ["alice","alice@gmail.com"],
#     ["neet","bob@gmail.com","neet@gmail.com"],
#     ["neet","neetcode@gmail.com"]
# ]

# Output: [["neet","bob@gmail.com","neet@gmail.com","neet_dsa@gmail.com"],["alice","alice@gmail.com"],["neet","neetcode@gmail.com"]]
# Example 2:

# Input: accounts = [
#     ["James","james@mail.com"],
#     ["James","james@mail.co"]
# ]

# Output: [["James","james@mail.com"],["James","james@mail.co"]]
