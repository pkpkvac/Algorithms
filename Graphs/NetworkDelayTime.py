# You are given a network of n directed nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of directed edges where times[i] = (ui, vi, ti).

# ui is the source node (an integer from 1 to n)
# vi is the target node (an integer from 1 to n)
# ti is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the source to the target node (an integer greater than or equal to 0).
# You are also given an integer k, representing the node that we will send a signal from.

# Return the minimum time it takes for all of the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the nodes to receive the signal, return -1 instead.

# Example 1:

# Input: times = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[1,4,4],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 1

# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: times = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]], n = 3, k = 2

# Output: -1

# Why This is Perfect for Dijkstra:
# 1. Single-source shortest path: Find shortest time from node k to all other nodes
# 2. Weighted graph: Each edge has a travel time ti
# 3. Non-negative weights: All times â‰¥ 0 (required for Dijkstra)
# 4. The key insight:
# Signal travels simultaneously to all paths
# All nodes receive signal when the  FURTHEST node gets it
# So answer = max(shortest_time_to_each_node)
