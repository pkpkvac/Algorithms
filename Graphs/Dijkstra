What Dijkstra Does:
Finds the shortest path from a starting point to all other points in a graph.
Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine you're at a bus station with routes to different cities:
Goal: Find cheapest way to reach every city
Method: Always explore the cheapest unvisited destination first
Keep track: Minimum cost to reach each city so far

1. Start at source, distance = 0
2. Put all other nodes at distance = infinity
3. While there are unvisited nodes:
   a. Pick unvisited node with smallest distance
   b. Look at all its neighbors
   c. Update their distances if you found a shorter path
   d. Mark current node as visited

   A--2--B
   | |
   1 3
   | |
   C--1--D

Start at A, want shortest path to D:
Step 1: A(0) → C(1), B(2)
Step 2: From C → D(2) [1+1]
Step 3: From B → D(5) [2+3], but 2 < 5, so keep D(2)
Answer: A→C→D = distance 2
