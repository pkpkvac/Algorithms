🔑 The ONE Question That Decides Everything:
"Do different edges have different weights?"

YES → Use Dijkstra:
Network Delay Time: Different travel times between nodes (1ms, 4ms, etc.)
Path with Minimum Effort: Different costs for height differences
Cheapest Flights: Different flight prices
Keywords: "minimum cost", "minimum time", "weighted edges"

NO → Use BFS:
Binary Matrix Path: All moves cost 1 step
Word Ladder: All word transformations cost 1 step
Rotting Oranges: All infections take 1 minute
Keywords: "minimum steps", "shortest path" + equal weights

🧠 The Mental Model:
Think of it like transportation:
BFS = City bus system
All stops cost $2.50 (equal weight)
Just count stops to destination
Simple queue works perfectly

Dijkstra = Uber/taxi system
Different routes cost different amounts (weighted)
Need to track cheapest route so far
Priority queue required to always explore cheapest option first

My Learning Recommendation:

Phase 1 (Now): Master Graph Fundamentals
DFS/BFS traversal
Connected components
Cycle detection
Topological sort

Phase 2 (Later): Advanced Patterns
Union-Find
Dijkstra's algorithm
Advanced DP on graphs


When you see:
1. Dependencies (A needs B)
2. Connections between items
3. Directional relationships
4. Need to find paths/order

Think Graph!

Joint (Connected AND Directed):
    4
   ↙ ↘
  1   2   All courses connected
   ↘ ↙    through dependencies
    3

Cyclical (Creates Impossible Schedule):
1 → 2
↑   ↓     Can't start anywhere!
3 ←       (Impossible to complete)

Key Concerns:
Direction matters (prerequisites)
Cycles make schedule impossible
Can have multiple independent groups
Need to handle all these cases!
This is why it's a graph problem!

2 ways to view:

	1. Prerequisites List (What I Need):

prereqs = {
    1: [4],    # To take course 1, need course 4
    2: [4],    # To take course 2, need course 4
    3: [1,2],  # To take course 3, need courses 1 and 2
    4: []      # Course 4 has no prerequisites
}

Visual:
       4
     ↙ ↘      Arrows point FROM prerequisite
    1   2     TO the course that needs it
     ↘ ↙
       3
	
	2. Dependency List (Who Needs Me):
	
depends = {
    1: [3],    # Course 1 is needed by course 3
    2: [3],    # Course 2 is needed by course 3
    3: [],     # Course 3 isn't needed by anyone
    4: [1,2]   # Course 4 is needed by courses 1 and 2
}

Visual: (same graph, different perspective)
       4
     ↗ ↖      Arrows point FROM course
    1   2     TO courses that depend on it

Cycle Detection:
	Two main ways:
	1. DFS with visited set
	2. Topological Sort
