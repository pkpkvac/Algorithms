You are given the root of a binary tree, return the post order traversal of its nodes' values.

left, right, root

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output: [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,null]

Output: [4,2,5,3,1]
Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []
Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
