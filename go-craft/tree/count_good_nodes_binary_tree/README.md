Within a binary tree, a node x is considered good if the path from the root of the tree to the node x contains no nodes with a value greater than the value of node x

Given the root of a binary tree root, return the number of good nodes within the tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [2,1,1,3,null,1,5]

Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,-1,3,4]

Output: 4
Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
