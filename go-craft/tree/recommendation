  Problem: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
  Why: Hard but very common at Google/Meta

	On brute force path between two nodes:

  brute force would be: for every pair of nodes, find the path between them and sum it.

***  How to find path between two nodes:
  1. Find their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
  2. Path = (A → LCA) + (LCA → B)

  *** This is a real technique worth knowing, but it's O(n²) and overkill for this problem.

	*** Learn this technique for the interview, but don't use it for this problem.
