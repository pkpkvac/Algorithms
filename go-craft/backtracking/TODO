Recommended order:
Combination Sum II — start here
Builds on Combination Sum
Adds handling duplicates (sort + skip duplicates)
Good warm-up
Permutations II — next
Builds on Permutations
Adds handling duplicates
Similar pattern to Combination Sum II
Combinations — third
Similar to Subsets but with fixed size
Reinforces the pattern
Generate Parentheses — fourth
Introduces a new pattern (valid parentheses generation)
Uses backtracking with constraints (open/close counts)
Common interview problem
Word Search — fifth
Introduces 2D grid backtracking
Uses visited tracking and path exploration
Important pattern for grid problems
Why this order:
First three build on what you know (duplicates, fixed size)
Generate Parentheses introduces a new constraint pattern
Word Search introduces 2D grid backtracking
After these, tackle Palindrome Partitioning, Letter Combinations of a Phone Number, then the harder ones (Matchsticks to Square, Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets, N Queens, Word Break II).
Start with Combination Sum II to reinforce the pattern with duplicates.
