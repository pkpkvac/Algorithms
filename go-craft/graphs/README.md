Word Ladder — third
BFS shortest path (not just traversal)
String transformation pattern
Very common interview problem

Why this order:
Course Schedule II reinforces what you just did
Rotting Oranges introduces multi-source BFS
Word Ladder teaches BFS shortest path
You're not behind. You've covered:
Grid DFS/BFS (Number of Islands, Max Area, Island Perimeter)
Graph traversal (Clone Graph)
Cycle detection (Course Schedule)
That's a solid foundation. These next 3 will round out your graph toolkit.

Tier 1 — Must know (core patterns):
Number of Islands — Classic DFS/BFS on a grid. Foundation for many grid problems.
Course Schedule — Topological sort (Kahn's algorithm or DFS). Common interview pattern.
Clone Graph — Graph traversal with a visited map. Tests deep vs shallow copy understanding.

Tier 2 — High value (builds on Tier 1):
Max Area of Island — Variation of Number of Islands; teaches counting during traversal.
Course Schedule II — Topological sort with result tracking.
Word Ladder — BFS for shortest path; common interview problem.

Tier 3 — Good practice (variations):
Rotting Oranges — Multi-source BFS; good for understanding BFS expansion.
Surrounded Regions — Boundary DFS; reverse thinking pattern.
Graph Valid Tree — Union-Find or DFS cycle detection.

Tier 4 — Nice to have:
Pacific Atlantic Water Flow — More complex DFS; less commonly asked.
Walls And Gates — Multi-source BFS variation.
Number of Connected Components — Union-Find basics.
Redundant Connection — Union-Find application.

Recommended learning order:

Number of Islands (DFS/BFS basics)
Clone Graph (graph traversal)
Course Schedule (topological sort)
Max Area of Island (variation)
Word Ladder (BFS shortest path)
Why these:
Cover DFS, BFS, and topological sort
Frequently asked in interviews
Build on each other
Teach core graph patterns
