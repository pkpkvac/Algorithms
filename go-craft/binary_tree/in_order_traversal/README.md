You are given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output: [4,2,5,1,6,3,7]
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,null]

Output: [2,4,1,5,3]
Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []
Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
