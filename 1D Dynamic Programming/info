dynamic programming

1. first write your base case
2. then define the recurrence relation

Tabulation (Bottom-up): "Build a table from small to big"
Start: "I know T(0), T(1), T(2)"
Build: "Now I can find T(3), then T(4)..."
Like climbing stairs step by step

Memoization (Top-down): "Ask the question, then find what you need"
Start: "I want T(n)"
Ask: "What do I need?" â†’ T(n-1), T(n-2), T(n-3)
Keep asking until you reach known answers
Like asking for help from smaller problems
