BREADTH FIRST SEARCH STRATEGIES (QUEUE)

	    1
	  /   \
	 2     3
	/ \   /
 4  5  6

1. Standard Level Order (left to right)
   - Visit: 1 → 2,3 → 4,5,6
   - Uses queue
   - Most common BFS approach

DEPTH FIRST SEARCH STRATEGIES (STACK)

1. Preorder (root → left → right)
   - Visit: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 3 → 6
   - Goes deep left first
   - Root processed before children

2. Inorder (left → root → right)
   - Visit: 4 → 2 → 5 → 1 → 3 → 6
   - Goes deep left first
   - Root processed between subtrees
   - Gives sorted order for BST

3. Postorder (left → right → root)
   - Visit: 4 → 5 → 2 → 6 → 3 → 1
   - Goes deep left first
   - Root processed after children
   - Good for:
     * Computing heights
     * Deletion
     * Child-before-parent problems
